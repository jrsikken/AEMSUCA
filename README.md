# AEMSUCA
The AEMSUCA is a 15x20mm board for the AEM10941 Solar Harvesting IC from E-peas. It efficiently converts solar panel energy into SUperCApacitor charge, it even works with indoor light. It features two regulated outputs that are enabled when the supercapacitor has sufficient charge, and a low voltage warning that informs the user of impending shutdown when the supercapacitors run low. It easily integrates in other projects because of the castellated via's, and when soldered onto 0.1' pitch header it fits in a bread board.
